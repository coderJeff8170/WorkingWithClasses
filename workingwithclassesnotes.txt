json give you objects from databases
classes have certain things like hasInstanceOf that are useful to determine things about the objects
OOP object oriented progrramming
Classes are functions using a constructor

-encapsulation
    hide implementation and expose as a method()
    (hide the programming code and just give the useful part)

-inheritance
    properties inherited from higher levels in the prototype chain



-polymorphism
    overriding inheritance on an instance

instances of a class will inherit properties from that class, but will also have properties
specific to that instance. Property values can be overridden (polymorphism) - and will take precedence on the more
specific instance?
